Cassanova
=========

Project Abstract:

Goal of the Project:

This project is mainly for learning purpose.  There are several Java tools that I want to brush up on before I join my next
Android development position.  On top of that there are several computer science concept I want to test out such as :Data-mining,
Machine Learning and software architecturing that I want to learn by practicing.

Phase 1 Features:

Big Picture: To be able to connect to multiple online dating sites and convert it to actural dates.  
The purpose of this is not to mass approach but to pre-screen and teach the program through Machine learning so it will enhance user
experience on both ends of the spectrum.  On top of that, it will do most of the admin task for the cassanova user to save time and
escalate the interaction quickly.

There are several requirments:

1)Not trying to spam the site
2)Only message users that are most likly convertable
3)Make the user think it is a genuine person that they are interacting.
4)Have a defined metric that I can improve the program on

Features:

1)Connect to the Web and access the ajax pages
2)Click through links
3)Input into forms and submit
4)Save results to database (Users, messages)
5)Filter in profile pages that are compatible with the cassanova user 
6)An algorithm that after a message has been replied by a user, can prolong the thread and convert it to a phone number.  
The style of the messages have to be geunie and fit the personality of the cassanova user.

Future Iteration:

1)Use the same process, technologies and features for
  a)Poker bot
  b)Online marketing
  c)Applying for job position
  d)screening out resumes
